## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was great practice for using CSS grid and flexbox. I often struggle with deciding when to use
these two layout tools. Having more practice boosted my confidence.

### Continued development

I hope to continue practicing with these two layout tools so I can make responsive sites more efficiently
and easier.
